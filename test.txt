A calendar time, also called an absolute time, is a point in the time continuum,
 for example July 29, 2021 at 13:02:5 CET.
  A time interval is a continuous part of the time continuum between two calendar times;
   for instance the hour between 15:00 and 19:00 on February 20, 2020. An elapsed time is the length
    of an interval, for example, 38 minutes.


-----Errors----------------------------
errors.New constructs a basic error value with the given error message

a NIL value in the rror positions indicates that there is not error

A Sentinel error is predeclared variable that is used to 
signify a specific error condition


it's common to use an inline error check in the if line.


errors.Is checks that a given error (or any error in tis chain)
matches a specific error value. this is especially useful with wrapped or nested errors.
