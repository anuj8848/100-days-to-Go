A calendar time, also called an absolute time, is a point in the time continuum,
 for example July 29, 2021 at 13:02:5 CET.
  A time interval is a continuous part of the time continuum between two calendar times;
   for instance the hour between 15:00 and 19:00 on February 20, 2020. An elapsed time is the length
    of an interval, for example, 38 minutes.
